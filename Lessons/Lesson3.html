    <h1>Lesson 3:   Writing Word</h1>

    <p>
        When writing words in NeoTaylor you can ignore how words are spelled
        in English usually and just go by how they sound. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Words are written with each consonant stroke connected together like
        cursive.
    </p>

    <p>
        NeoTaylor is what is known as an abjad. This means that you should
        avoid writing vowels when not neccesary. Generally speaking it
        is not neccesary to write vowels if they are not diphthongs or
        if they are in the middle of a word. Vowels that are pronounced at the
        start or end of a word should always be written.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since vowels are not written inline with the rest of the word any
        medial vowel should be written after the rest of the word is written.
