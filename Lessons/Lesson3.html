    <h1>Lesson 3:   ST Stroke and Hooks</h1>

    <p>
        The consonant pair ST is very common in English words and as such 
        it has it's own stroke. The ST sound is represented as a vertical downstroke
        with a hook on the left side of it. Like a backwards Th stroke[14].

    <p>
        Straight downstrokes or horizontal strokes followed by an R sound can be
        written as the downstroke with a small hook on the end. The hook can be
        on either side of the stroke. The use of the hook R over the stroke R
        depends on context but generally tend to use the hook[12].

    <p>
        Using the ST stroke and R hook rule we can create a single stroke
        for another common consonant combination of STR. Which is the ST 
        stroke followed by an R hook.

    <p>
        Straight upstrokes followed by a K sound are always written 
        with a small hook at the end[13].
