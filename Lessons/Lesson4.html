    <h1>Lesson 4:   Intersection Rule</h1>

    <p>
        Sometimes in NeoTaylor you will run into a word where two letters
        join together in such a way that it only looks like the first letter
        was elongated. In standard Taylor you would simply write this as 
        the first letter extended. However NeoTaylor writes words more
        compactly by writing a small tick through the stroke. This also
        applies to if the same letter is pronounced twice like in the -ses
        suffix.
