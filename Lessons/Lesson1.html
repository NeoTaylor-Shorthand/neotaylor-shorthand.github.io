    <h1>Lesson 1:   Basic Word</h1>

    <p>
        Before we get started I would like to note that NeoTaylor is a
        heavy-line system. Meaning that you should try to write it in a
        way such that you can write thin lines and thick lines in one stroke.
        The best way of acheving this would be with a fountain pen or pencil.
        However if this is not possible then while it will be harder to read
        back most of the shading is used to distinguish letters which already
        had double meaning in standard Taylor. I do recommend that if you are
        going to use light lines that you write D as a downward diagonal
        stroke (/) and R as an upward diagonal stroke (and as a longhand R
        if written alone).

    <p>
        Some of the letters in the alphabet do not directly align to
        English letters. Ch makes the sound in words like "Chair", Sh makes 
        the sound in words like "shading", Zh makes the sound in words like
        "measure", and Th makes the sound in words like "the" or "thursday".
    </p>

    <p>
        Words are written with every stroke connected to each other like in
        cursive[1]. Looped letters can have the loop on either side[2].
        They are written how they sound (their phonetics) as opposed to how 
        they are commonly written in longhand (orthographics)[5].
    </p>
    <p>
        However NeoTaylor is known as an abjad. Meaning vowels are seldom written.
        A word like "cat" would be written as "K-T", "dog" would be written as "d-g", etc.
        Vowels are only written if they are pronounced at the start or end of a word. In 
        that case all vowels are written the same using the omnivowel dot. If the stroke
        is vertical then the dot is on the left or right and if horizontal then
        the dot is on the top or bottom depending on if the vowel is at the start
        or end of the word respectively[3]. Diphthongs which are two vowels pronounced
        at the same time like "oi" are represented with the same omnivowel dot[4].
    </p>
    <p>
        In the middle of a word the letters H and Y should be omitted[6]. Double letters
        in the middle of a word also should be omitted[7]. Consonant pairs like Th, Ng, etc
        should always be written. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Words that sound like long O like "oh" or "owe" are written as a standalone loop like
        a longhand O[10].
