    <h1>Lesson 1:   Alphabet and Basic Words</h1>

    <h2>Preface</h2>
    <p>
        Before we get started I would like to make a note on the nature of
        this system...
    </p>

    <p>
        NeoTaylor is a heavy-line system. This means that quite a few letters
        are distinguish from others by the darkness or thickness of the stroke
        and not by shape. The best way of doing this is by writing with
        a pencil or fountain pen or any other writing implement that
        allows for thin/light and thick/dark strokes.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, if you are not able to or simply wish to not to differentiate
        strokes on the basis of thickness/darkness then you can choose not to.
        If you are new and simply scared to try it out then do give it a try
        for a while. From my experience it is not as uncomfortable as it may
        seem. 
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have already tried it and don't like using shading or
        cannot then most of the letters that are differentiated are already
        double letters in standard Taylor so if you are used to standard Taylor
        avoiding shading shouldn't be too much of a hassle. I would recommend you
        write your standalone R's as a lowercase print "r" and D as a diagonal line
        like R but as a downstroke. Again this is not optimal because
        it is much more difficult to read back but is allowed.
    </p>

    <h2>The Alphabet</h2>

    <p>
        Each letter always makes the same sound. Whereas in English a letter like
        G could make a sound like in "Gary" or in "age" the G in Taylor always
        makes the G sound like in "Gary".
    </p>

    <p>
        Some of the letters in the NeoTaylor alphabet don't directly align with
        letters in the English alphabet. Ch makes the sound like in "Chay". Sh 
        makes the sound like in "Shade". Zh makes the sound like in "Measure". 
        Th makes the sound like in "The" or "Thistle".
