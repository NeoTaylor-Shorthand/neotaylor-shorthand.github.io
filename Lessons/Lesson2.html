    <h1>Lesson 2:   Vowels</h1>

    <img src="\Res\vowels.png">
    <p>
        The top row of vowels are called monophthongs and the bottom
        row of vowels are called diphthongs.
    </p>

    <p>
        Vowels in NeoTaylor are written differently from consonants. Instead of
        being written in line with the rest of the word they are written
        on the flanks of the consonant they are pronounced with. The exception to 
        this is if a word ends in O in which case the loop is joined to the last
        consonant.
    </p>

    <p>
        If a vowel is pronounced before a consonant then it is written above or 
        to the left of it. If a vowel is pronounced after a consonant then it is
        written below or to the right of it.
    </p>

    <p>
        The dot I vowel does not make the long I sound. That sound is
        represented with the diphthong Ie.
    </p>

    <p>
        The double O sounds are represented by the U vowel.
    </p>

    <p>
        If two vowels are pronounced back to back the they the first one
        to be pronounced is written closer to the consonant. 
    </p>

    <p>
        If a diphthong and monophthong are pronounced back to back it is called
        a triphone. They are written as the diphthong with a tick before or after
        representing the monophthong.
