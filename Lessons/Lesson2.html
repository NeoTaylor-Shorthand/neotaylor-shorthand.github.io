    <h1>Lesson 2:   Intersection</h1>

    <p>
        Sometimes in NeoTaylor you will run into a word where two letters
        join together but look very similar. Where the only difference between
        the first letter and the letter pair is that the first letter is 
        extended. In standard Taylor all you would do is extend the letter. 
        But in NeoTaylor intersections are used.
    </p>

    <p>
        If two letters join together such that the only way to represent
        them is by extending a part of the first letter (like M-S, P-T, etc)
        then a line is put through the first letter to represent the second one.
        This also applies if a hookless or loopless letter is pronounced twice 
        (like the -SES suffix)[11].
