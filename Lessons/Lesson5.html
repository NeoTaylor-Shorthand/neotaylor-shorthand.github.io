    <h1>Lesson 5:   ST Stroke and Hooks</h1>

    <p>
        The consonant pair ST is very common in English and as such has
        its own stroke. The ST sound is represented as a vertical downstroke
        with a hook on the left side of it. Like a mirrored Th stroke.
    </p>

    <p>
        Straight downstrokes or horizontal strokes followed by an R sound
        can be written as the downstroke with a small hook on the end. The
        hook can be on either side of the stroke. The use of the R hook over
        the R stroke is dependent on context and how well either joins to the 
        rest of the outline. However the hook should tend to be used.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the ST stroke and R hook rule combines to create a single
        stroke for the STR consonant combination.
    </p>

    <p>
        Straight upstrokes followed by a K sound are always (not optionally) 
        written with a small hook at the end.
