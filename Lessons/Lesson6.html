    <h1>Lesson 6:   Brief Forms</h1>

    <p>
        Common words in English have special spellings called brief forms.
        These brief forms make writting NeoTaylor much faster. They should
        be memorized as thoroughly as the alphabet is. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The top-left most brief forms (A, I, On, And, To) are all written noticably
        smaller than the normal outlines as to not look like other letters or
        words. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The brief forms "Lord" and "God" can be further distinguished from the other
        L and G brief forms by marking them with the proper-noun mark.
    </p>

    <p>
        Phrasing is when brief forms are written in one outline. They should
        generally be 3 or less strokes in size and only contain brief forms.
        Phrases should not use intersections. Rule 9 also applies to phrasing.
