    <h1>Lesson 6:   Punctuation</h1>

    <p>
        Punctuation—being mostly unimportant in deriving the meaning of a
        section of writing—can be omitted. However if needed the following
        marks can be used.
    </p>

    <p>
        Marks with the "x" shape in them can be written with the lines of the
        "x" joined together. It should look similar to the F-L pair but noticably
        smaller as to not cause confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
        The proper-noun mark is used when something is a specific person, place,
        or thing. It is not use exactly like capitals in English since the word
        at the start of a sentence is not always marked with the proper-noun mark.
    </p>
