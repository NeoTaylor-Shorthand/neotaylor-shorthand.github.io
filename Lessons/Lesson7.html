    <h1>Lesson 7:   Affixes</h1>

    <p>
        When affixes are written the root word should stay the same. For example
        the word "make" is spelled as M-A-K and the word "makes" is spelled
        M-A-K-S and not M-A-X.
    </p>

    <p>
        The -s suffix is always written as the S stroke. Even if it makes the
        Z sound. The -ses suffix is written as an S with an intersection.
    </p>

    <p>
        The -ed suffix is written as a disjoined D stroke. If the root word ends
        in D (hence -ded) then an intersection is written through the last D to
        represent the -ed suffix.
    </p>

    <p>
        The -y suffix is written as I vowel at the end of the word.
    </p>

    <p>
        The -ing(s) suffix is written as a small dot near the tip of the last consonant.
        It should not be written on the flanks of the last consonant as to not cause
        confusion between it and the I vowel.
    </p>

    <p>
        The -tion(s) suffix is written as a small dash near the tip of the last
        consonant. Same as -ing(s) it should not be written on the flanks of the
        last consonant as to not cause confusion between it and the A/E vowels.
    </p>

    <p>
        The following letters can represent affixes if written disjoined to the
        rest of the word.

        <ul>
            <li>B: -ble</li>
            <li>F: -ful, for-</li>
            <li>M: -ment(s)</li>
            <li>N: -ness</li>
            <li>S: -self-</li>
            <li>W: -ward</li>
            <li>Sh: -ship-</li>
            <li>Loop O: -out-</li>
        </ul>
