    <h1>Example Writting: Sample from George Orwell's 1984 by LJC</h1>
    <p>
        "The-thing that-he-was about to-do was-to open a diary. This was-not
        illegal (nothing was illegal since there were no longer any laws), 
        but if detected it-was reasonably / certain that-it would be punished
        by death, or-at least by twenty five years in a forced labour camp. 
        Winston fitted a nib into-the penholder and sucked it-to get the 
        grease off. / The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even 
        for signatures, and he-had procured one furtively and with some
        difficulty, simply because of a feeling that-the beutiful creamy
        paper / deserved to-be written on with a real nib instead of being
        scratched with an ink pencil. Actually he-was-not used to writing by
        hand. Apart from very short notes, it-was usual / to dictate everything
        into-the speak write which-was of course impossible for-his present purpose.
        He dipped the pen into-the ink [and] then faultered for just a second. 
        A tremor had gone through his bowels. / To mark the paper was-the decisive 
        act. In small clumsy letters he wrote: April 4th, 1984."
