    <h1>Writing Rules</h1>

    <p>
        This is the list of the official writing rules for NeoTaylor. In the
        lessons there will be square brackets with a number inside of them. 
        Those refer to one of the rules found here.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Strokes are written connected to each other like in
            cursive.
        </li>

        <li>
            Looped strokes can have their loop on either side of the stroke.
        </li>

        <li>
            Vowels are only represented if pronounced at the start or end of
            a word. All vowels are represented by a beginning or final omnivowel
            dot. If a stroke is vertical or diagonal the dot goes on the 
            left if beginning and to the right if ending. If a stroke is 
            horizontal then the dot goes on top if beginning and on the bottom
            if ending.
        </li>

        <li>
            Diphthongs, triphones, etc are represented in the same way 
            as normal vowels.
        </li>

        <li>
            Words are written as they sound. Not as they are exactly
            written in longhand.
        </li>

        <li>
            Medial H and Y should be omitted.
        </li>

        <li>
            Medial double letters should be omitted.
        </li>

        <li>
            Always write consonant pairs like Th, Ng, etc.
        </li>

        <li>
            Tend to omit articles and other words that do not
            add meaning to the text which cannot be infered by
            the reader.
        </li>

        <li>
            Words that sound like long O are written as a loop. Like the 
            longhand letter O.
        </li>

        <li>
            If two similar straight strokes are written together such that
            the differentiated one (shaded, hooked, or looped) is before
            the undifferentiated one then the differentiated one is written
            with a line through it. This also applies to if a hookless or loopless
            letter is pronounced twice.
        </li>

        <li>
            Straight downstrokes or horizontal strokes followed by an
            R sound can have a small hook at the end to represent the R sound
            instead of the R stroke. The use of either depends on how well
            it joins to the next letter.
        </li>

        <li>
            Straight upstrokes followed by a K sound are always written with a 
            small hook at the end.
        </li>

        <li>
            The consonant pair ST is written as a backwards Th stroke.
        </li>

        <li>
            The -s suffix is always written as S even if it makes the
            Z sound.
        </li>

        <li>
            The -ses suffix is written as an S with an intersection.
        </li>

        <li>
            The -ed suffix is written as a disjoined D stroke. If the
            root word ends in D (hence -ded) then an intersection is 
            put through the last D.
        </li>

        <li>
            The -y suffix is written as a final vowel dot.
        </li>

        <li>
            The -ing(s), -tion(s), and -ly suffix are all written
            as a terminal loop; distinguished by context.
        </li>

        <li>
            The following letters if written disjoined represent the
            following affixes:
            <ul>
                <li>B: -ble</li>
                <li>F: -ful, for-</li>
                <li>M: -ment(s)</li>
                <li>N: -ness</li>
                <li>S: -self-</li>
                <li>W: -ward</li>
                <li>Sh: -ship-</li>
                <li>Loop O: -out-</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
